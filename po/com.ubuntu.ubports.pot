"UBports is an international community of developers and users who wish to "
"keep Ubuntu Touch alive. The project was founded by Marius Gripsgard in 2015 "
"as a place where developers can talk and learn from each other and help "
"bring Ubuntu to more devices as a team. After Canonical announced the end of "
"their support for Ubuntu Touch, the operating system was picked up by the "
"community. The resonance has been fantastic and our community is growing "
"rapidly."

"It's our goal to keep Ubuntu Touch alive on all existing devices. While "
"keeping all its good and beautiful parts, we want to reshape Ubuntu Touch to "
"make it the operating system we want to use on a daily basis. Ubuntu is "
"Linux for human beings, and Ubuntu Touch brings this spirit to mobile "
"devices. We want to turn Ubuntu Touch into a true Linux distribution for "
"mobile devices, while keeping its simple and elegant design."
